# Resume

This is a repo for my resume. Built with a Swiss design theme, heavily inspired by [Damian Watracz's design](https://dribbble.com/shots/1768058-Swiss-Style-Resume-2014).

## Development

Pull in dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start tailwind CLI to generate CSS and web server to see updates:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch

npx serve
```
